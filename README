RestExpress is a thin wrapper on the JBOSS Netty HTTP stack to provide a simple and easy way to create
RESTful services in Java.

Born to be simple, only three things are required to wire up a service:
1) The main class which looks just like the JBOSS Netty examples.
2) A RouteMapping extender (much like routes.rb in a Rails app), which contains DSL for the
   supported URLs and HTTP methods of the service(s).
3) Service implementation(s), which is/are a simple POJO--no interface or super class implementation.

See: examples/kickstart directory to get started (there is a README there).

===================================================================================================
A quick tutorial:

* HTTP Methods, if not changed in the DSL, map to the following:
1) GET --> read(Request, Response)
2) PUT --> update(Request, Response)
3) POST --> create(Request, Response)
4) DELETE --> delete(Request, Response)

You can choose to return objects from the methods, if desired, which will be returned to the client as
body of the response.  The object will be marshaled into JSON or XML, depending on the default or based on the
format on the request.

If you choose to not return a value from the method (void methods), then call response.setResponseNoContent()
before returning to set the response HTTP status code to 204 (no content).

On successful creation, call response.setResponseCreated() to set the returning HTTP status code to 201.

Change History:
===================================================================================================
Release 0.5.2
* Introduced DateJsonProcessor (sibling to DefaultJsonProcessor) which parses dates vs. time points.
* Refactored ExceptionMapping.getExceptionFor() signature from Exception to Throwable.
* Introduced MessageObserver, which accepts notifications of onReceived(), onSuccess(), onException(), onComplete() to facilitate logging, auditing, timing, etc.
* Changed RouteResolver.resolve() to throw NotFoundException instead of BadRequestException for unresolvable URI.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.5.1
* Enhanced support for mark, unreserved and some reserved characters in URL. Specifically, added
  $-+*()~:!' and %.  Still doesn't parse URLs with '.' within the string itself--because of the
  support for .{format} URL section.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.5
* Renamed repository from RestX to RestExpress.
* Repackaged everything from com.strategicgains.restx... to com.strategicgains.restexpress...
* Changed DefaultHttpResponseWriter to output resonse headers correctly.
* Updated javadoc on RouteBuilder to provide some documentation on route DSL.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.4
* Fixed error in "Connection: keep-alive" processing during normal and error response writing.
* Can now create route mappings for OPTIONS and HEAD http methods.
* Added decoding to URL when Request is constructed.
* Improved pre-processor implementation, including access to resolved route in request.
* Better null handling here and there to avoid NullPointerException, including serialization resolver.
* Improved UT coverage.
* KickStart application builds and is a more accurate template.

===================================================================================================
Release 0.3
* Added support for "method tunneling" in POST via query string parameter (e.g. _method=PUT or _method=DELETE)
* Added JSONP support. Use jsonp=<method_name> in query string.
* Utilized Builder pattern in DefaultPipelineFactory, which is now PipelineBuilder.
* Externalized DefaultRequestHandler in PipelineBuilder and now supports pre/post processors (with associated interfaces).
