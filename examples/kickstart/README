This kickstart project illustrates how to create a simple RestExpress project.  Complete with Ant build, 
it contains a skeleton main() class, RestServer, and an empty, but functional service.

Copy the lib/ directory of RestExpress, along with the dist/ directory of RestExpress into the lib directory
for the kickstart application.  Ant should compile the project.  Then:

1) Change the Routes.java file to match your URL requirements using the using the RouteBuilder DSL.
2) Implement the functionality for those URLs in a service class, much like KickstartService does.
3) Impress your superiors with the speed at which you've completed your tasks.

Alternatively, there is a kickstart zip file generated in the release process.  Simply:

1) Unzip the file.
2) Run ant to build it.
